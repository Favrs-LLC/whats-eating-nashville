LOGO INSTRUCTIONS:

Please save the horizontal "What's Eating Nashville" logo image you provided as:
/Users/williambridges/Desktop/projects/whatseatingnashville/public/logo.png

The logo should be:
- Horizontal format with "WHAT'S Eating NASHVILLE" text
- Blue text for "WHAT'S" and "NASHVILLE" 
- Red script text for "Eating"
- Blue circular element
- Clean, professional design

Once you save the logo as logo.png, the navigation and admin panel will display it correctly with the sizing I've configured:
- Navigation: h-8 w-auto (height 32px, auto width)
- Admin panel: h-6 w-auto (height 24px, auto width)

The logo will automatically appear in:
- Main navigation bar
- Admin panel header
